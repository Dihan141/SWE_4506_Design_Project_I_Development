# Client

The frontend for this project was implemented in react vite. And it was deployed to netlify.
Although this project was written in react typescript but the underlying code had some issues so we had to use loglevel during npm build to bypass the warnings in our initial deployment. I do hope in the near future to improve this and deal with the potential bugs and warnings.
